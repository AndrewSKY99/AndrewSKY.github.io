<h1>Hello I am Andrew Siew</h1>
<p>
  Bio: I graduated Nanyang Polytechnic with a Diploma in Business Intelligence & Analytics.<br/>
  My hobbies are playing computer games (recently been playing DBD) and keeping fit.<br/>
  I hope to refresh myself on CSS and Javascript in this module as it has been 4/5 years since I last touched it.

  I don't have much photos of just myself so please bare with this pretentious photo taken years ago
